     <p>They say love can make the wisest of men into fools... 
        That love can shake you to your core, melt you at a look, and write a whole other life for you. Being in love makes you almost invincible, you can do anything because you’ll always have somewhere to leave your heart. A message from the one you love can send your heart racing, smile wide, and can calm the worst in you. Love can build you, Love can break you; you showed me this. 
        So, when I heard my first love story, I knew I had to find you.  <%= link_to "Continue", genre_tale_path(10, 4), :class => 'navbar-link'  %></p>
